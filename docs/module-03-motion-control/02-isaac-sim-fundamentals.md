# Isaac Sim Fundamentals

*Content coming soon. This chapter will cover:*

## Isaac Sim Interface

- Main viewport and camera controls
- Stage tree (scene hierarchy)
- Property panels
- Content browser
- Toolbar and menus
- Extensions manager

## USD (Universal Scene Description)

- What is USD and why NVIDIA uses it
- Prims, attributes, and relationships
- Stage, layers, and composition
- Loading and saving USD files
- Asset management best practices

## Building Environments

- Creating basic shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders)
- Importing 3D models (FBX, OBJ, GLTF)
- Materials and textures (PBR workflow)
- Lighting (dome, directional, area, point lights)
- Ground planes and rooms
- Physics properties (mass, friction, restitution)

## Robot Assets

- Importing URDF files
- USD-based robot definitions
- Joint configuration and control
- End-effector setup
- Sensor attachment points
- Asset library (Franka, UR robots, mobile platforms)

## RTX Rendering

- Ray tracing fundamentals
- Path tracing vs rasterization
- Material properties (metallic, roughness, opacity)
- Reflections and refractions
- Global illumination
- Denoising and quality settings

## Physics Simulation

- PhysX 5 engine configuration
- Rigid body dynamics
- Collision detection
- Articulations (robot joints)
- Soft bodies and cloth (advanced)
- Fluid simulation (optional)

## Camera and Sensors

- Camera types (perspective, orthographic, fisheye)
- Sensor placement on robots
- RGB cameras
- Depth cameras
- Segmentation cameras
- LiDAR configuration

## Hands-On Exercises

1. **Build a Room**: Create a multi-room environment with furniture
2. **Import a Robot**: Load a robot URDF and configure it
3. **Set Up Lighting**: Achieve photorealistic rendering
4. **Add Sensors**: Attach cameras and LiDAR to your robot
