# Welcome to Humanoid Robotics with ROS 2

This book is a comprehensive guide that will take you from ROS 2 fundamentals to building and integrating complete humanoid robotic systems. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your robotics knowledge, you'll find practical, hands-on content throughout.

## What You'll Learn

This book covers humanoid robotics through **4 comprehensive modules**:

- **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System** - Master ROS 2 fundamentals including nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Module 2: Robot Perception** - Learn sensor integration, computer vision, and environment understanding
- **Module 3: Motion Control** - Understand kinematics, dynamics, and control systems for humanoid movement
- **Module 4: Humanoid Integration** - Build complete systems integrating perception, planning, and control

Each module includes working code examples, hands-on exercises, and troubleshooting guidance to ensure you can apply concepts immediately.

## How to Use This Book

This book is organized into 4 modules with multiple chapters each:

- **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System** - Start here to build your ROS 2 foundation
- **Module 2: Robot Perception** - Add sensing and vision capabilities
- **Module 3: Motion Control** - Master movement and manipulation
- **Module 4: Humanoid Integration** - Bring everything together
- **Appendix** - Quick reference materials and glossary

Use the sidebar navigation to explore topics, or use the search function at the top right to find specific information quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python or C++)
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu (basic terminal commands)
- ROS 2 Humble installed (installation guides provided in Module 1)
- A curious mind and willingness to experiment with real robots

## Getting Started

Ready to begin? Start with **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System**, where you'll learn what ROS 2 is, understand nodes and topics, and write your first robotic applications.

Enjoy your robotics journey!
