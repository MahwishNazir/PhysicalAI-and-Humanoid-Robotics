# Environment Building

*Content coming soon. This chapter will cover:*

## World Design Principles

- Planning environments for robot testing
- Scale and dimensions for realistic spaces
- Obstacle placement and density
- Accessibility for different robot types
- Testing scenarios (navigation, manipulation, interaction)

## Terrain Generation

- Heightmaps for natural terrain
- Procedural terrain generation
- Slopes, hills, and valleys
- Rocky, sandy, and uneven surfaces
- Multi-material terrain (grass, dirt, pavement)
- Water and liquid surfaces

## Lighting and Shadows

- Directional light (sun) configuration
- Point lights and spotlights
- Ambient lighting and global illumination
- Shadow quality and performance
- Day/night cycles
- Indoor vs outdoor lighting strategies

## Objects and Props

- Furniture and indoor objects
- Outdoor structures (buildings, trees, rocks)
- Dynamic objects (movable, interactive)
- Asset libraries and model importing
- Level of detail (LOD) for performance
- Collision mesh optimization

## Weather and Environmental Effects

- Fog and atmospheric scattering
- Rain and snow particles
- Wind effects on objects
- Temperature simulation (optional)
- Weather impact on sensors (camera visibility, LiDAR reflections)

## Multi-Floor Buildings

- Creating interior spaces
- Stairs, elevators, and ramps
- Doors and windows
- Room layouts and navigation
- Ceiling heights and confined spaces

## Procedural Generation

- Parametric world creation
- Random obstacle placement
- Maze and labyrinth generation
- City block generation
- Benefits for machine learning (varied training data)

## Performance Optimization

- Culling and visibility management
- Physics complexity reduction
- Texture atlasing and compression
- Mesh simplification
- Update rate tuning
- Parallel simulation (multiple worlds)

## Real-World Environment Replication

- Measuring and modeling actual spaces
- Photogrammetry basics
- LiDAR scanning for environment capture
- Importing CAD models
- Validation against reality

## Hands-On Projects

1. **Warehouse Environment**: Build a multi-aisle warehouse with shelves and pallets
2. **Outdoor Park**: Create natural terrain with trees, paths, and obstacles
3. **Multi-Story Building**: Design a 3-floor building with stairs and rooms
4. **Dynamic Scene**: Add moving obstacles and changing lighting
