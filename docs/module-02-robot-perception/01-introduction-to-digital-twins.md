# Introduction to Digital Twins

*Content coming soon. This chapter will cover:*

## What are Digital Twins?

- Definition and history of digital twins
- Differences between simulation, emulation, and digital twins
- Applications in robotics, manufacturing, and beyond
- The simulation-to-reality pipeline

## Why Simulation Matters

- Cost and time savings in robot development
- Safe testing of dangerous scenarios
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Data generation for machine learning
- Validation before hardware deployment

## Simulation Platforms Overview

- **Gazebo**: Open-source physics simulation
- **Unity**: High-fidelity rendering and HRI
- **PyBullet**: Lightweight Python simulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: GPU-accelerated AI training
- Choosing the right tool for your project

## The Reality Gap

- What is the sim-to-real gap?
- Sources of discrepancy (physics, sensors, dynamics)
- Strategies to minimize the gap
- Domain randomization techniques
- Real-world validation approaches

*For now, explore [Gazebo Tutorials](https://gazebosim.org/docs) and [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub).*
