# Glossary

Quick reference for robotics and physical AI terms used throughout this book.

## A

**Action**: In ROS 2, a communication pattern for long-running tasks that provide feedback, result, and can be preempted.

**Actuator**: A component that produces motion or force in response to control signals (e.g., motors, servos).

## B

**Bipedal Locomotion**: Walking or movement using two legs, characteristic of humanoid robots.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The number of independent parameters that define the configuration of a robotic system.

## E

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence that exists in a physical form and interacts with the real world through sensors and actuators.

**End-Effector**: The device at the end of a robotic arm designed to interact with the environment (e.g., gripper, tool).

## F

**Forward Kinematics**: Calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector given the joint angles.

## G

**Gazebo**: An open-source 3D robotics simulator for testing and developing robot algorithms.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A sensor that measures acceleration and angular velocity to determine orientation and motion.

**Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: Calculating the joint angles needed to position a robot's end-effector at a desired location.

## J

**Joint Space**: The coordinate system defined by the angles or positions of a robot's joints.

## L

**LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging - a sensor that uses laser light to measure distances and create 3D maps.

## N

**Node**: In ROS 2, an independent process that performs computation and communicates via topics, services, or actions.

## P

**Physical AI**: AI systems that operate in and interact with the physical world through robotic embodiment.

**Proprioception**: A robot's sense of its own body position and configuration through internal sensors like joint encoders.

**PyBullet**: A Python module for physics simulation, commonly used for robotics research and development.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A middleware framework for building robot applications with tools for inter-process communication, device control, and system orchestration.

## S

**Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate or comprehensive understanding of the environment.

**Service**: In ROS 2, a synchronous request/response communication pattern between nodes.

**Sim-to-Real**: The process of transferring policies or behaviors learned in simulation to real-world robots.

## T

**Topic**: In ROS 2, an asynchronous communication channel where nodes can publish and subscribe to messages.

## Z

**Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: A point on the ground where the total horizontal forces acting on a bipedal robot equal zero, critical for balance control.
