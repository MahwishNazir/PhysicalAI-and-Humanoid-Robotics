## Hands-On Code

### Example 1: [Basic Task] (Beginner)

**What You'll Learn**: [Key concept this example demonstrates]

**Prerequisites**:
- Isaac Sim 2023.1+ installed
- Python 3.10+
- [Any specific dependencies]

**Setup**:
```python
# Import required packages
from omni.isaac.kit import SimulationApp
import numpy as np
# [Additional imports...]
```

**Complete Code**:
```python
# [Full working example with extensive comments]
# Explain what each section does

def main():
    """
    Main function demonstrating [concept].

    This example shows how to [specific goal].
    """
    # Step 1: Initialize simulation
    simulation_app = SimulationApp({"headless": False})

    # Step 2: [Next step with explanation]
    # ...

    # Step 3: Cleanup
    simulation_app.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[Sample terminal output]
[Description of visual result in Isaac Sim window]
```

**How It Works**:

1. **Line 10-12**: [Explanation of initialization]
2. **Line 15-20**: [Explanation of main logic]
3. **Line 25**: [Explanation of cleanup]

**Common Issues**:

- **Error**: "Module 'omni.isaac.kit' not found"
  - **Solution**: Ensure Isaac Sim is installed and Python path is configured

- **Error**: "Simulation won't start"
  - **Solution**: Check that `headless=False` and no other Isaac Sim instance is running
```

#### Example 2: Intermediate Application (Intermediate level)
