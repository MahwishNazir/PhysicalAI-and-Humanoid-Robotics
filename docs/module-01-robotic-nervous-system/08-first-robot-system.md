# Building Your First Robot System

*Content coming soon. This chapter will be a hands-on capstone project:*

## Project: Autonomous Navigation Robot

You'll build a complete system that:
- Reads sensor data (camera, lidar)
- Processes environment information
- Plans a safe path
- Controls motors to navigate
- Visualizes everything in RViz2
- Runs in Gazebo or PyBullet simulation

**Skills Applied:**
- Creating multiple interacting nodes
- Designing topic architectures
- Implementing services for coordination
- Launching the full system
- Debugging multi-node systems
- Testing in simulation

*For now, review all previous chapters and practice the exercises. This project will tie everything together!*
