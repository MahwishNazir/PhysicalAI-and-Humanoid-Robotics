# Diagram: DOPE Pose Estimation Pipeline
**File**: dope-pose-estimation.png
**Type**: Technical pipeline diagram
**Purpose**: Illustrate DOPE inference from RGB to 6-DOF pose

## Pipeline Stages
1. RGB Image (640x480) → 2. CNN Encoder → 3. Belief Maps (8 keypoints) → 4. Peak Detection → 5. PnP Solver → 6. 6-DOF Pose

Visual: Show image transformations at each stage with example box object

## Alt Text
"DOPE pipeline: RGB image through CNN encoder producing belief maps for 8 object keypoints, peak detection extracts 2D locations, PnP solver recovers 6-DOF pose (position + orientation quaternion)"
