# Diagram: Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline

**File**: data-generation-pipeline.png
**Type**: Flow diagram / Data pipeline
**Purpose**: Visualize end-to-end synthetic data generation workflow in Isaac Sim

## Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1: Scene Setup**
```
Input: USD assets, robot models
↓
Actions:
- Load environment (warehouse, outdoor, lab)
- Spawn objects (randomized)
- Position cameras/sensors
↓
Output: Initial scene graph
```

**Stage 2: Randomization**
```
Input: Scene graph + randomization parameters
↓
Actions:
- Lighting: Intensity (200-3000 lux), color temp
- Textures: PBR materials from library
- Poses: Object positions, camera viewpoints
- Physics: Mass, friction variations
↓
Output: Randomized scene instance
```

**Stage 3: Simulation & Rendering**
```
Input: Randomized scene
↓
Actions:
- Step physics (settle objects)
- Render RGB (raytracing/rasterization)
- Render depth (distance map)
- Render semantic (class IDs)
- Render instance (object IDs)
↓
Output: Multi-modal sensor data
```

**Stage 4: Annotation Extraction**
```
Input: Rendered sensor data
↓
Actions:
- Bounding boxes from instance masks
- Polygon masks from segmentation
- 3D bounding boxes from depth
- Point cloud labeling from lidar
↓
Output: Ground truth annotations
```

**Stage 5: Quality Validation**
```
Input: Image + annotations
↓
Checks:
- Object count > threshold
- Object size > minimum pixels
- Brightness in valid range
- No annotation errors
↓
Output: Pass/Fail decision
```

**Stage 6: Export**
```
Input: Validated samples
↓
Format conversion:
- COCO JSON (detection/segmentation)
- KITTI (3D detection, odometry)
- TFRecord (TensorFlow)
- Custom formats
↓
Output: Training-ready dataset
```
