# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 3 - Isaac Platform, Navigation & AI Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification comprehensively covers all 8 chapters of Module 3 (Isaac Platform through AI Pipeline Capstone) with clear learning objectives, functional requirements, success criteria, and scope boundaries.

**Specification Strengths**:
- 6 prioritized user stories mapping to logical chapter groupings
- 70 detailed functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-070)
- 15 measurable success criteria focusing on student outcomes
- Clear dependencies on Module 1-2 and Isaac Sim platform
- Well-defined scope with explicit out-of-scope items
- Pedagogical structure enforced across all content
- Detailed content template structure (7 sections per chapter)
- Word count targets and quality standards defined

**Clarifications Added (2025-12-25)**:
- Added FR-061 through FR-070: Detailed content structure requirements
- Added "Content Template Structure" section with 7-section breakdown
- Added word count targets per section (2000-3500 words total/chapter)
- Added code quality standards (Python 3.10+, PEP 8, docstrings)
- Added diagram requirements (minimum 3/chapter, vector format)
- Specified exercise difficulty levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Defined chapter summary format (3-5 takeaways + further reading)

**Ready for Planning**: This specification can proceed to `/sp.plan` for implementation planning.
