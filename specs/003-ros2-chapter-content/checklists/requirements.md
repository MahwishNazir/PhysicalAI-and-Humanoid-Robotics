# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced ROS 2 Chapter 1 - Comprehensive Content

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of educational content requirements
- Well-defined success criteria focused on learning outcomes
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: Beginners, P2: Quick reference, P3: Instructors)
- Edge cases address practical concerns (platform availability, link rot, distribution differences)
- Appropriate assumptions about reader background and environment

**Ready for next phase**: `/sp.plan` can proceed to create implementation design.
