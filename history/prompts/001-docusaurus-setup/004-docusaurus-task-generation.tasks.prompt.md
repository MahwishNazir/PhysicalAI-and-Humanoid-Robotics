## Response snapshot

Generated complete implementation task list for Docusaurus book interface setup with 63 tasks organized by user story.

**Task Organization**:

**Phase 1: Setup** (5 tasks)
- Verify Node.js/npm prerequisites
- Initialize Docusaurus with scaffolding tool
- Clean up default content
- Create asset directory structure
- Configure .gitignore

**Phase 2: User Story 1 - Initial Book Structure (P1)** (19 tasks) 🎯 MVP
- Configuration: 6 tasks for docusaurus.config.js and sidebars.js
- Content Structure: 7 tasks for intro page and part directories with _category_.json files
- Verification: 6 tasks for running dev server and testing
- **Independent Test**: Verify Docusaurus runs at localhost:3000 with sidebar and homepage

**Phase 3: User Story 2 - Add and Organize Chapters (P2)** (13 tasks)
- Create sample chapters for Part I (2 tasks)
- Create sample chapters for Part II (2 tasks)
- Create appendix content (2 tasks)
- Sidebar verification (5 tasks)
- Section outline verification (2 tasks)
- **Independent Test**: Multiple chapters appear in correct order, clicking loads content

**Phase 4: User Story 3 - Chapter Content Management (P3)** (17 tasks)
- Rich markdown content (3 tasks: formatting, code blocks, callouts)
- Image integration (4 tasks: add images, reference, verify, error handling)
- Internal linking (3 tasks: add links, verify navigation, test broken links)
- External links and downloads (3 tasks)
- Content rendering verification (4 tasks)
- **Independent Test**: All markdown features render correctly

**Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns** (9 tasks)
- Custom CSS styling
- Footer and favicon updates
- Search functionality testing
- Production build and serve
- Cross-browser and mobile testing
- Constitution compliance verification

**Key Metrics**:
- **Total Tasks**: 63
- **Parallel Tasks**: 24 marked [P]
- **Sequential Critical Path**: ~39 tasks
- **Estimated Time**: 65-95 minutes (aligns with SC-001: <30 min setup + chapter creation)

**Task Format** (all tasks follow strict format):
```
- [ ] T### [P?] [Story?] Description with exact file path
```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Setup: 2 tasks (asset dirs, .gitignore)
- US1: 6 tasks (part directories and _category_.json files)
- US2: 6 tasks (all chapter creation)
- US3: 10 tasks (content enhancements)
- Polish: 3 tasks (CSS, footer, favicon)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **MVP First**: Phases 1-2 only (User Story 1) = Working book interface in 20-30 minutes
- **Incremental**: Add US2 (chapters), then US3 (rich content), then polish
- **Checkpoints**: Each user story independently testable

**Dependencies**:
- Setup → blocks all
- US1 (P1) → blocks US2 and US3
- US2 (P2) → blocks US3
- US3 (P3) → blocks Polish
- User stories are sequential but self-contained

**Success Criteria Mapped**:
- SC-001 (<30 min setup): Tasks T001-T024
- SC-002 (<1 min add chapter): Tasks T031-T035
- SC-003 (90% search): Task T058
- SC-004 (<2s load): Tasks T060-T061
- SC-005 (navigation accuracy): Tasks T032-T035
- SC-006 (100% markdown): Tasks T051-T054
- SC-007 (mobile readable): Tasks T024, T062

**Notes**:
- Tests NOT requested in spec, so no test tasks included
- Testing is manual browser verification
- Each task includes exact file paths
- Autogenerated sidebar reduces manual maintenance
- All tasks immediately executable by LLM or human

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task list ready for implementation, MVP clearly defined
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing only (not requested in spec)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with 63 tasks across 5 phases
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute tasks, or begin manual implementation starting with Phase 1
- 🧠 Reflection: Book project tasks are straightforward—mostly configuration and content creation. No complex code. MVP achievable in <30 minutes as specified.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; all tasks derived from quickstart guide and user stories
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation - PASS (all 63 tasks follow checklist format)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task generation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute Phase 1-2 (MVP) and validate 30-minute setup target
